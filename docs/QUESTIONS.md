# 🤖 What can I ask the AI Assistant?

Your AI assistant has been upgraded to understand context, analyze multiple messages, and remember your conversation history. Here are the types of questions you can ask to get the best insights from your WhatsApp chats.

## 1. 📝 Summarization & Overviews
Get a quick digest of long conversations.
*   "Summarize what we talked about yesterday."
*   "Give me a summary of the discussions about the [Project Name]."
*   "What were the main topics discussed last week?"
*   "Catch me up on what I missed in the last 2 days."

## 2. 🔍 Specific Information Retrieval
Find specific details without scrolling through thousands of messages.
*   "What is the address for the party?"
*   "Did anyone share a link to the budget spreadsheet?"
*   "What time did John say he would arrive?"
*   "Find all the phone numbers shared in the chat."
*   "Who recommended the movie 'Inception'?"

## 3. 👥 User Interactions & Opinions
Understand group dynamics and individual contributions.
*   "What does Sarah think about the new design?"
*   "Who is most active in the morning?" (Note: better for the Analytics tab, but AI can answer if discussed)
*   "Did Mike agree with the plan?"
*   "Who was the most excited about the trip?"

## 4. 📅 Timeline & Events
Track when things happened.
*   "What happened on January 15th?"
*   "When did we first discuss the vacation?"
*   "Create a timeline of the project updates mentioned in the chat."

## 5. 💡 Context & Follow-up Questions (New!)
Since the AI now has memory, you can ask follow-up questions naturally.
*   **User**: "What did we decide for dinner?"
*   **AI**: "You decided on Italian food at Mario's."
*   **User**: "Who suggested that?" (The AI knows "that" refers to Mario's)
*   **User**: "And what time are we going?"

## 6. 🎭 Fun & Trivia
*   "What are the funniest things said about [Topic]?"
*   "Who uses the word 'lol' the most?"
*   "Write a poem based on our chat about the road trip."

## 💡 Pro Tips for Best Results
*   **Be Specific**: Instead of "What happened?", ask "What happened regarding the meeting on Tuesday?".
*   **Use Names**: Refer to people by the names saved in your contacts/chat.
*   **Ask for Lists**: "List all the book recommendations shared."
